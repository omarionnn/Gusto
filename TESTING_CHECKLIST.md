  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK

## Integration Tests (Requires Real API Keys)

### Full Test Workflow

1. **Start Test**
   - [ ] Enter a real website URL

   - [ ] Progress updates appear in right panel
   - [ ] Live view iframe shows the website
   - [ ] Can see Claude making decisions
   - [ ] Actions are logged in real-time

3. **Stop Test** (Optional)
   - [ ] Click "Stop Test" button
   - [ ] Test status changes to "STOPPED"
   - [ ] Browserbase session ends

4. **View Report**
   - [ ] Wait for test to complete (status: "COMPLETED")
   - [ ] Click "View Report" button
   - [ ] Redirected to `/report/[testId]`

5. **Report Page**
   - [ ] Summary cards display metrics
   - [ ] Session recording link is present
   - [ ] All tabs work (Summary, Actions, Issues, Pages)
   - [ ] Actions timeline is expandable
   - [ ] Export JSON button works

## Database Tests

### Check Database File
```bash
ls data/
# Should show: browser-tests.db
```

- [ ] Database file exists
- [ ] Database contains tables (tests, reports, action_logs)

### Verify Test Data
After running a test:
```bash
sqlite3 data/browser-tests.db "SELECT id, url, status FROM tests LIMIT 5;"
```

- [ ] Tests are recorded in database
- [ ] Status field is updated correctly

## Error Handling Tests

### Invalid URL Test
1. Go to homepage
2. Enter invalid URL (e.g., "not a url")
3. Click "Start AI Test"

- [ ] Error message displays
- [ ] No server crash
- [ ] Can retry with valid URL

### 404 Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/nonexistent
```

- [ ] Returns 404 status
- [ ] Returns proper JSON error
- [ ] Server logs the request

### Server Shutdown Test
1. Start backend server
2. Press Ctrl+C

- [ ] "Shutting down gracefully..." message appears
- [ ] Running tests are cleaned up
- [ ] Database closes properly
- [ ] Process exits cleanly

## Performance Tests

### Backend Response Times
- [ ] Health endpoint responds < 100ms
- [ ] Test start responds < 2 seconds (with valid keys)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Backend won't start
- Check Node.js version (needs 18+)
- Verify .env file exists and has valid keys
- Check port 3001 is not in use: `lsof -i :3001`
- Check npm install completed successfully

### Frontend won't start
- Check Node.js version
- Verify .env.local exists
- Check port 3000 is not in use
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Clear .next folder: `rm -rf .next`

### Tests fail to start
- Verify Browserbase API key is valid
- Check Browserbase project ID is correct
- Verify Anthropic API key has credits
- Check internet connection

### Database errors
- Delete database and restart: `rm data/browser-tests.db`
- Database will be recreated automatically
- Check file permissions in data/ directory

### Live view not loading
- Check Browserbase session was created
- Verify live view URL is correct
- Try opening live view URL in new tab
- Check for iframe blocking in browser
